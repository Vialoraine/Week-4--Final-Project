## The Challenge üîê

I was tasked to build an application using the knowledge of JavaScript that I learned over the past week to create a front-end application that I can show potential employers.

## The Concept üé§

Kanto Pokedex is a web application that serves as a comprehensive guide to first generation of Pokemon. It allows users to search for information on different Pokemon species, including their characteristics, abilities, types, and evolutions. The website is built using basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and it utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch data on Pokemon.

## User Story üìñ

```
AS A user,
I WANT to get a view information about all first generation Pokemon

```

## Features üíª

Pokedex offers the following features:

```
Search for Pokemon by name or Pokedex number
Get detailed information about a specific Pokemon, including its types, abilities, stats, and evolutions
View a list of all Pokemon and browse through them
Filter Pokemon based on their types
View popular Pokemon and their rankings
View top-rated Pokemon based on their stats
Explore Pokemon evolutions and their evolutionary paths

```

## The Process üìù

To satisfy my project goals, I had to:

- Create an HTML file
- Create a JavaScript file that imports web server API from PokeApi
- Modify HTML file to dynamically work with JavaScript file and CSS file

## Installation

To install Pokedex, follow these steps:

- Download the source code from the repository
- Extract the files from the downloaded ZIP archive.
- Open the index.html file in your web browser.
